# Image
You have an image, that you either build yourself or that you pull from the docker hub. This image contains the environement for the container and all the necessary files.

Its basically just a blueprint.

Kind of like when we make a class, that class is blueprint that can be compared to an image. When we create an instance we still have the class that this instance was built from. Same goes from images, a container is like an instance.

# Container
Containers are basically packed up instances that come from an image.

# Docker hub
Its just a cloud library with a bunch of images where you can find and store prebuilt docker images
