# Concept
Docker containers as basically instances, once they are running, they can be used as they are, they can be altered, changed and modified, but not be saved in any way. Meaning once they are stopped or restart, all changes are lost. For example. We can install a fedora image, install `htop` to it, but once that container dies, `htop` will be gone.

# Solution
If we however, want to keep the changes of a container, we need to make a new image, based on the current state of the container. That way we have a new blueprint, that includes the new states. As for the example above, we need to commit the container to a new image with `htop` installed.

# Syntax
`docker commit [container] [new container]`, we can also add some flags to it, check `docker commit --help`

# Methods
- How to make changes to a container and build an image from it
    - run a fedora image with `-d` and `-it` flags
        - `-d` - detached (runs in bg)
        - `-i` - makes it interactive
        - `-t` - assign a terminal to it
    - attach to the container that is running
        - install `htop`
        - commit it
        - escape an attached container with `ctrl+p+q`
        - re-run the original to see if `htop` is there (it shouldnt be because containers are stateless)
        - run the committed image, see if `htop` is there (it should be, if its the container from the image we committed)
