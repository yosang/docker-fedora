1. CD to the application that has the `Dockerfile`
2. Run `docker build -t myexpressjs .`
    - the `-t` flag is just a tag, we need to name the image with this
    - the `.` at the end refers to the directory from where the `Dockerfile` is to be used to build this image.
3. If everything goes well, we should now have an image, check with `docker images`
4. Run the new image `docker run -d -p 3030:3030 expressjs`
5. The container should now be running, check it on `docker ps`
6. navigate to `http://localhost:3030`, and voila, all good.
