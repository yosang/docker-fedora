Lets inspect our container files to see what could have been done better
- Run `docker ps` to get the container id of `expressjs`
- Run `docker exec -it [container] bash`
    - `exec` allows us to execute a command in a container that is running
    - `i` makes it interactive
    - `t` adds a pseudo termial to it, (tty)
    - `bash` - allows us to use the bash shell inside
- Run `ls -l` to list all files inside the container
- From here we can see that `Dockerfile` is there, `app.js` is also there, all the `package.json` fun is there, and `node_modules` as well, this is all good, means the container has what it needs to function.
- A good idea here would be to make a directory where the these files can go in. Lets explore that in the next .md
