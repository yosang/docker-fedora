# System
Docker can be installed on windows, mac and linux. However, Dockers is natively based on the Linux Kernel and needs its existence in order to work.

On windows, they worked this out by installing the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), which provides a Linux Kernel ON windows that Docker Desktop can use.

On MAC, Docker desktop uses a lightweight virtual machine (VM) to provide the linux kernel for Docker to function.

On both these systems Docker is often used with Docker Desktop which is a graphical user interfance, and if you want to use it through the CLI, you are going to need a unix command line tool like bash for it.

On Linux, you dont have any of these problems, as Docker uses the Linux Kernel that exists on the host. This is the best place to use docker, because on windows you need WSL, that is a bridge and not the straight source, on mac you need VM, which is using some CPU resource.

The downside is that on linux, docker desktop it not great, so you need to use the terminal

Im on linux, the fedora 42 cosmic spin and thats what Im going to be using for docker.

# Windows
Just download Docker-desktop and follow instructions
# Mac
Just download Docker-desktop and follow instructions

# Linux
Debian use `apt`, installing docker is done with `sudo apt install docker.io`, or by downloading their deb.

follow the docks
- docker repository
- dockerdocks recommends using their repository, so you need to add that first
- https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/ - docker

## fedora rpm
- on fedora we can install directly from the rpm
- Red Hat uses `dnf`, installing docker here is done with `sudo dnf install docker-cli containerd`
    - `docker-cli` is what we need to interact with docker, using `docker` command
    - `containerd` - is the runtime, or the engine itself.
