# Image
You have an image, that you either build yourself or that you pull from the docker hub. This image contains the environement for the container and all the necessary files.

Its basically just a blueprint.

Kind of like when we make a class, that class is blueprint that can be compared to an image. When we create an instance we still have the class that this instance was built from. Same goes from images, a container is like an instance.

## Commands
- docker images - lists available images
- docker pull - pulls an image directly from the docker hub.
- docker run - creates and runs a container from an image from the current list or pulls it from docker hub if it exists there instead
- docker stops - stops one or more running containers
- docker rmi - removes an image (cant be used if a container exists)

# Container
Containers are basically packed up instances that come from an image.

# Docker hub
Its just a cloud library with a bunch of images where you can find and store prebuilt docker images
