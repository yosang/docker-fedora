# What it is
Its a container based technology that allows developers to encapsulate applications in single containers and run within a filesystem environment
with all the dependencies and libraries it needs.

It does not require an operative system, which is what makes it more portable and resource efficient compared to virtualization.

# Architecture
- Operative system (the host where docker exists)
    - Docker engine (has the daemon, cli, docker-compose and so on)
        - Docker images (read-only blueprints to create containers)
            - Docker containers (lightweight isolated environments running applications and its dependencies)

# Why use it?
Because you only need docker installed on ANY machine, either it be windows, mac or linux to run an image and create a container.
This removes the issues where developers create applications that run perfectly on their machine, but suddenly break when distributed because of some lack of dependencies or other design faults.
Once you develop an application, your image should be able to create a container and run this isolated application on any machine.
